                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Web development is a relatively new pursuit for me, 
                        but I have been a master troubleshooter throughout my 
                        entire life. When I was small, as a leader of our 
                        neighborhood kid brigade, I would be charged with drawing 
                        up drafts of plans to build time machines and rocket ships 
                        (who didn't when they were young?), in particular taking 
                        lead on figuring out how we might cobble together such 
                        complex vehicles with the old car parts and junk
                        scattered around in the surrounding woods.

                        Thankfully, the tools available to software engineers 
                        are much more robust! Figuring out fresh ways to 
                        utilize the tools at hand towards building something 
                        incredible is one that will never run the risk of getting 
                        old to me; itâ€™s safe to say that the software development 
                        landscape of what can be learned - and what can be created 
                        - is unending. I look forward to traversing that landscape 
                        for many years to come.
                    </p>

                        Coding is just one of many threads of passion in my 
                        life- I'm also a trumpet-playing, crazy-dancing member 
                        of a street band, and co-founded the School of HONK, a 
                        nonprofit alternative music school. Or if I'm not in 
                        a spectacle-raising mood, I'm just as happy curling up 
                        with my cat Matto and reading a book I've borrowed 
                        from the local library.
